# Responsive Design Bookmarklet Generator

## About
This is a simple script that lets you view any webpage in multiple screen sizes, simulating the viewport of different devices. It works by generating a custom bookmarklet containing whatever screen dimensions you're interested. You can then just click the bookmark to view any current webpage in a variety of sizes. Simple!

## Demo
